**0-My first postmortem**
Issue Summary:
Duration: May 12, 2024, 10:00 AM - May 12, 2024, 12:00 PM (UTC)
Impact: The Apache service running in the container failed to return the expected page, affecting all users attempting to access the service. Approximately 100% of users were affected.
Root Cause: Misconfiguration of the Apache service within the Docker container.
Timeline:
10:00 AM: The issue was detected when users reported receiving an empty reply or error message when querying the root of the Apache service.
10:05 AM: Engineers began investigating the issue, suspecting a misconfiguration or service failure.
10:30 AM: Initial investigation focused on Docker container logs and Apache service configuration files, searching for any anomalies.
11:00 AM: Misleading paths were explored, such as potential network issues or conflicts with other services, but no conclusive evidence was found.
11:30 AM: The incident was escalated to the DevOps team for further assistance.
12:00 PM: The incident was resolved by correcting the misconfiguration within the Apache service.
Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: The Apache service within the Docker container was misconfigured, preventing it from properly serving the expected page.
Resolution: The misconfiguration was identified and corrected by adjusting the Apache service configuration files within the Docker container. Specifically, the virtual host configuration was updated to correctly serve the desired content.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements/Fixes:
Ensure thorough testing of Docker container configurations before deployment.
Implement robust monitoring to promptly detect and alert on service failures.
Tasks:
Patch Apache service configuration files to prevent similar misconfigurations in the future.
Implement automated testing procedures to verify service functionality prior to deployment.

Issue Summary:
Duration: May 12, 2024, 10:00 AM - May 12, 2024, 12:00 PM (UTC)
Impact: The Apache service decided it needed a siesta, failing to serve the expected page and leaving users scratching their heads. Approximately 100% of users were affected, leading to a surge in confused emojis.
Root Cause: The Apache service within the Docker container decided to play hide-and-seek, misconfiguring itself into oblivion.
Timeline:
10:00 AM: The issue popped up like a surprise guest at a party when users reported receiving an empty reply or an error message from the Apache service.
10:05 AM: Engineers donned their detective hats and dove into the investigation, suspecting foul play in the form of misconfiguration or service shenanigans.
10:30 AM: The hunt led to Docker container logs and Apache service configuration files, akin to searching for a needle in a haystack.
11:00 AM: Misleading paths were explored, including conspiracy theories involving network gremlins and service sabotage, but alas, the truth remained elusive.
11:30 AM: With no luck in sight, the incident was escalated to the DevOps team, who arrived like cavalry to the rescue.
12:00 PM: Victory! The misconfiguration was vanquished, and the Apache service was coerced back into its proper function, serving web pages like a well-behaved server should.
Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: The Apache service within the Docker container had a bit too much to drink from the configuration fountain, leading to a case of mistaken identity and subsequent service failure.
Resolution: The misconfiguration was swiftly wrangled into submission by updating the Apache service configuration files within the Docker container. Think of it as giving the server a much-needed reality check.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements/Fixes:
Implement a strict "no-drinking-on-the-job" policy for Apache service configuration files.
Enhance monitoring capabilities to detect misconfigurations before they wreak havoc.
Tasks:
Patch Apache service configuration files to prevent future identity crises.
Roll out automated testing procedures to ensure service functionality remains on its best behavior.
